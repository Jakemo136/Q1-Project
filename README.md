## Project Proposal B - ..........?

Provide a brief description about your project that answers the following questions:

I know it's required to submit two ideas, but I didn't even get the idea to do a portfolio site until today, after talking with Ben. 
I didn't come into this with ideas of things I want to build, just the desire to learn how to build things, so this is a huge challenge for me, personally.
