## Project Proposal B - Typing Speed & Accuracy Test

Provide a brief description about your project that answers the following questions:

* What problem or need does your project solve?
    Everyone wants to get better at typing! I acknowledge that this might be surprisingly more complicated than I'm initially aware of

* Who would be a user of your website?
    Pretty much anyone who types. People who use a keyboard for productivity or as a regular part of their life and want to improve their ability.

* What technologies will you be using?
    Whewwww.... It's gonna need an attractive layout, but not too complicated. Frameworks, I'm assuming there will be some heavy DOM for the typing test, and some local storage to show your previous best.
